NaiveBayesClassifier
====================

The Naive Bayes Algorithm uses probabilities to perform classification. The probabilities are estimated based on training data which the value of the classification is known.

Like other supervised algorithms, the algorithm is consisted of two phases: training and classfying.

See the project_spec.pdf for a full description of the project.

A final report document is included which is covering the issues and topics I encountered during the implementation.

To run the classifier, rub bayesian_classifier.rb file with command 'ruby bayesian_classifier.rb'.

I will add test suites very soon.
